#### Overall UX Design Process

- **Research**
  - [Existing website review](#existingwebsitereview)
  - Competitive Analysis - *See how others solve similar problems and try to not reinvent the wheel.*
  - Data analysis - *Do you have all the useful data you need? Try to have a look at funnels, clicks, page views, performances...*
  - User feedback - *Always speak with Customer Care team! Don't have one? Check your old surveys or videos, what your customer says? What do they actually do?*
- **Plan**
  - User stories - *Have you done personas yet. If not DO IT NOW. Ok, now use them to write down user stories and scenarios.*
  - User flows - *Create your user's flow based on the scenarios you created, you can use it later to review the journey and create wireframes on top of each step.*
  - Red Routes - *Define red routes for your product and you’ll be able to identify, prioritise and eliminate any usability obstacles on key user journeys.*
- **Exploration**
  - Brainstorm & Sketching - *Find a war room, fill it with markers and drinks, get together and sketch, discuss, vote, disrupt, have fun!*
  - Wireframes - *Add some details and structure to your ideas, reuse patterns and create pages on top of your user flows so you'll not leave anything behind.*
  - IA prototypes - *You can start creating paper prototypes and continuously iterate to more functional ones. Use sketches, HTML pages or static images, then just get some people and test.*
- **Communicate**
  - IA - *Understand your users, your data structure and your channels. How can you organise your navigation and content in a clear and consistent way?*
  - Language - Follow your brand personality, keep in mind users' culture and language, the context of your product and make sure they understand you.
  - Accessibility - *You don’t need to add extra functionality or to duplicate any content. The key is simply to assess the requirements of those with different skills and limited devices.*
- **Design**
  - Create
    - Style guide
    - UI Elements - Reuse elements and patterns, follow your style guidelines, don't have one? Create your guidelines. Start small, then create pages.
    - Gestures - *So you have a swipe slider? Tell me more about pinch, drag, zoom, rotate, shake, six-inch smartphones, left handed people, mouseover, kinect, motion detection...*
    - Responsiveness - *Can I see it on my mobile? Oh wait, what about my smart-watch which work as a remote for my 50" TV. Bonus: remember cross device experience.*
  - Give feedback
    - Waiting times - *If your users have to wait ages for the page to load, at least show them a loader, if take longer why don't you try something more entertaining?*
    - Errors - *Be clear and specific on what and where user's error is. I mean, your error, because if it's your fault you should say it.*
    - Completed actions - *Give immediate and clear feedback of successful user's actions. Do not always wait for server response, trust your server once in a while!*
  - Finalise
    - Finalise layout - *It's time to let your design shine, make it in the right way, don't stop with the first solution, always ask "is this the best you can do?"*
    - Use of images and icons - *Use of icons and images is strongly influenced by context, culture and layout that you use. Like icons, test your images, small changes can bring huge improvements.*
    - Font & colours hierarchy
      - *Use colours and font sizes properly, tryto follow your guidelines and keep it simple. The best visual hierarchies lead users to take the action confidently.*
- **Quality Assurance**
  - Delight
    - Micro copy - *Every word is important, and a bit of personality will help your brand.*
    - Micro interactions - *Trigger, rules, feedback, loop. Details make the product. Bonus: Ever heard about easter eggs?*
    - Transitions - *Motion shouldn't be only beautiful, it should build meaning about the spatial relationships, functionality, and intention of the system.*
  - Speed tests/Errors
  - Finalise designs
  - Hand Off
- **Feedback**
  - KPI testing - *What you want to achieve? What are your goals? Write down how you define success and failure and check if you have everything you need to collect the data.*
  - A/B testing - *Plan your AB test ahead and, if you can, plan a short roadmap of improvements. Your goal is not just improving KPIs, but learning something.*
  - Test - *UX lab, survey, sessions recording... test, observe and fix, test, observer and fix...*

### Existing website review

A review methodology should be used to avoid snap judgements. Also allows for the review process to be much much organised so that when doing this repeatedly, you remain consistent.

An apparoach to doing this is called a Heuristic Website Review, heuristic meaning the measurement of something that cant readily be quantified.

> NOTE: Do not just a website based on it's visual appeal. Sites like amazon, ebay, google and even facebook may not be visually appealing but functionally are perfect

Take into consideration these broad categories when exploring the website in detail:
- Task orientation and website functionality,
- Navigation and information architecture,
- Forms and data entry,
- Trust and credibility,
- Quality of writing and content,
- Search,
- Help, feedback and error tolerance,
- Page layout and visual/aesthetic design,
- Accessibility and technical design.

> Alternatively there are Jakob Nielsens's 10 general principles for interaction design:
- Visibility of system status
- Match between system and the real world
- User control and freedom
- Consistency and standards
- Error prevention
- Recognition rather than recall
- Flexibility and efficiency of use
- Aesthetic and minimalist design
- Help users recognise, diagnose and recover from errors
- Help and documentation


Use these broad categories to formulate a set of questions to repeatedly ask through the website. Example when reviewing the layout and visual design ask;
 *Are standard elements (such as page titles, website navigation, page navigation and privacy policy) easy to locate?*
